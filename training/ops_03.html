    <h2>Operations Orientation 03</h2>
    <h3>Transporters</h3>
    <p>When a station, planet, or ship has had a detailed scan performed, it is
        registered with the transportation computers and you are able to select
        it as a transportation target, provided you are within range (10,000 km
        for most Federation starships, when full power is passed to the system).
        </p>
    <p>The range of the transporters may be extended by having your engineer
        set a higher power level to their system.</p>
    <p>You will have the option of transporting either Crew or Cargo--each uses
        a different transportation subsystem. If transporting cargo, you have
        the option of setting the target destination to any of your cargo bays.
        Crew may only be sent to the transporter room.</p>
    <p>Once you have selected a target, engage the transporter by activating the
        buffer control stips (click near the top of the bars), and wait for the
        cycle to complete. If a problem is encountered during a transporter
        cycle, a notice will appear explaining the problem, and the transport
        will be aborted.</p>
    <p>Transport beams can be disrupted by shields and other energy
        interference, so make sure your at least one of your ship's shields is
        down during a transport.</p>
