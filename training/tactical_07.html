    <h3>Targeting</h3>
    <p>Before firing any weapon, it is important the targeting computer first
        has a lock. Any known target within weapons range can be targeted.</p>
    <p>Subsystem targting becomes possible once a target has had a detailed scan
        completed by the science officer. This is useful if you wish to target
        specific components or systems onboard an enemy ship, allowing you to
        disable weapons, shielding, or any other component. Often it is good
        practice to target weapons fire if only to concentrate it and thus
        overcome any shielding around a ship.</p>
