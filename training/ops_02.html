    <h2>Operations Orientation 02</h2>
    <h3>Cargo</h3>
    <p>Most starships are equiped a series of cargo bays to provide for their
        long voyages between resupply points. Day to day operations onboard a
        starship require the use of materials for repairs and upkeep.</p>
    <p>It is important to keep a close watch on cargo levels when at a resupply
        point, and to make note of which systems require repairing, and what the
        needed supplies are, so that you may make recommendations and bring
        aboard the required material.</p>
