    <h2>Tactical Orientation 04</h2>
    <h3>Torpedoes</h3>
    <p>Torpedoes are the primary long-range weapon of space combat, and consist
        of an anti-mater war head mounted to a warp-extension engine, as well as
        several minor targetting thrusters.</p>
    <p>Given the catastrophic potential of a photon torpedo, it is possible to
        dial the explosive potential of the warheads down significantly,
        allowing for more tactical use. Damage yield is set by incrementing the
        setting from 1 to 16, which raises the yield exponentially.</p>
    <p>Familiarize yourself with the location of your ship's torpedo tubes, as
        this restricts the locations you may fire them. Most Federation ships
        equiped with torpedo tubes have them mounted forward, thus limiting
        the range of targets to those directly ahead of the ship.</p>
    <p>Torpedoes fired at warp are able to continue moving within a warp bubble
        thanks to their sustainment field, which makes them the most effective
        weapon against enemy ships during a chase.</p>
    <p>Torpedoes have a maximum range of 300,000 km.</p>
