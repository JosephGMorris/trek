    <p>
        The power distribution interface looks like the following:

    <span class='eng-sys-bar-frame'>
        <span class='eng-sys-bar-dark' style='width:20%'>
            &nbsp;
        </span><span class='eng-sys-bar-active' style='width:70%'>
            &nbsp;
        </span><span class='eng-sys-bar-red' style='width:10%'>
            &nbsp;
        </span><span class='eng-sys-marker' style='margin-left:50%'>

        </span>
    </span>
    <p>
        Every system has a minimum operational threshold, below which there is
        insufficient power to operate the system. Above this level, the system
        will function normally. There is also a maximum safe operating level,
        above which a system may begin to suffer damage if it is kept in this
        range. (An engineering crew may be assigned by the operations officer to
        a system to keep it's status intact as it runs over it's safe operating
        level.) In our example system, greyout occurs below 20% of maximum,
        while the maximum safe operating level is 90% of maximum. Here it is
        possible to boost the system another 10%, but you risk damage by doing
        so.

        It may become operationally important to push systems beyond their
        recommended levels in an emergency. If the system takes damage, the
        operations team may be able to repair it with onboard supplies, but
        there are some systems onboard which require more exotic supplies. It is
        best to inform the operations officer of any intent to overload a
        system.
