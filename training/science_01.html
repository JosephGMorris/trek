    <h2>Science Orientation 01</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>As a ship of exploration, the science officer is crucial to the mission
        of any Federation starship.</p>
    <p>Many different types of scanners are required to get an accurate sense of
        what is happening in deep space. The primary distinction is between long
        and short range scanners (those which use subspace or other means to
        gather information beyond the local range of light, and those that do
        not).</p>
    <p>In addition to the standard instrumentation, operational scanners, such
        as high-resolution scanning equipment, and internal environmental
        scanners are also operated and supervised by the science officer.</p>
