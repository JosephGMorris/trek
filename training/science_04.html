    <h2>Science Orientation 04</h2>
    <h3>Internal Scensors</h3>
    <p>
        The science stations also recieve notification of internal scensor
        alerts, which cover such situations as radiological alarms,
        environmental dangers, or atmosphere problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the event of an internal alert, it is critical to report the problem
        to the operations and command officers, so that any crew in danger may
        be safely evacuated.
