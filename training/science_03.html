    <h2>Science Orientation 03</h2>
    <h3>Detailed Scanning</h3>
    <p>
        A detailed scan is conducted on any object within range as a standard
        operating procedure. Not only is such a scan required to ascertain any
        potential transport sites, it is also required for the tactical officer
        to target any subsystem on the object in question, should the need
        arise.
    </p>
    <p>
        During a scan, you will have the chance to observe lifesigns, cargo, and
        system status of the object being scanned. It is your duty to report if
        any of these readings are relevant or unexpected to the rest of the
        bridge crew.
