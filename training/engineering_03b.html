    <h3>Power Distribution Safety</h3>
    <p>
        As an engineer, you have the ability to increase or decrease the power
        output of your various reactor sources. There may be many circumstances
        in your missions where is neccessary to completely cut power, or to
        immediately reduce the output of a power source. Very rarely, if ever,
        will you find yourself in a position where you need to directly increase
        the output of a reactor. There are safeties in place to warn you against
        doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a system requires more power, it is best to locate the distribution
        relay that the system is attached to (the warp realy, or one of the
        Port, Starboard, Aft, or Forward EPS grids), and to increase the power
        directly on the system. The ship's computer will calculate the required
        power distribution of the relay, and make the distribution change,
        before automatically dialing up the power of the origin reactor.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, if you find that your port shield is draining faster than
        it can maintain it's charge, say from enemy fire or ambient radiation,
        you will want to increase the power to that system. Since the port
        sheild is connected to the port EPS grid, which is in turn connected to
        the primary relay, which draws power from the warp core, you would have
        to in turn adjust the distribution and output settings on each of these
        systems before you would achieve the desired output on the port sheild.
        What's worse, if you do not correctly time the distribution and output
        adjustments, you will likely overload several other systems in the
        process.
    </p>
    <p>
        By far, the safest method of increasing power to the port shields is
        simply to select a higher level on it's power consumption bar.
