    <h2>Operations Orientation 05</h2>
    <h3>Crew Movement</h3>
    <p>Every starship comes with a variety of crew members, each to perform a
    specifi funtion. As operations officer, it is your duty to assign crew where
    they are needed most as various situations arise. Make use of the crew
    legend to understand what each indicator represents.</p>
    <p>Security teams provide internal security when intruders are present, and
    also help guard prisoners. If a boarding party beams onboard, you will have
    to assign secuirty teams to intersect them. Be advised that it may take more
    than one team to subdue an enemy.</p>
    <p>Medical teams provide medical aid to any crew member who is injured. If
        it is not practical to move a team to sickbay to seek medical attention,
        dispatching a medical team is a good alternative.</p>
    <p>Engineering teams are able to perform maintenance and improvements on
        ship's systems, allowing for the engineer to overpower certain
        components safely. The cheif engineer will often request engineering
        teams be sent to specific systems to guard them against damage from use.
        </p>
    <p>Repair teams are operational teams that fix any damage to the ship. You
        can assign them to dedicated systems in the repair menu.</p>
    <p>Science teams are useful for completing exploratory missions and tactical
        tasks. You will often need them on away missions.</p>
    <p>Guests and prisonners may also be aboard your ship. Be mindful of their
        location and safety during any sort of emergency.</p>
