    <h3>Environmental Science</h3>
    <p>
        External environmental factors are of immediate concern for a number of
        ship's systems, and your fellow bridge officers require up to date
        information to make correct and timely decisions.

        The local particle density restricts maximum warp value, as the
        navigational deflectors can only safely operate at certain tolerances.
        Also, local gravitational and subspace distortions will affect warp
        systems directly, and the engineering and navigation teams will need to
        be made aware.

        Ambient radiation readings are critical for the safety of the crew, and
        the bridge crew will need to know when the level has spiked so that
        additional power may be directed to the shields. (In the event that the
        ambient radiation has overpowered the shields, you will likely also get
        an internal sensor alert to indicate as much.)
