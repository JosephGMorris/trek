    <h3>Reading a scanner output</h3>
    <p>
        Scanning data is divided into segments around the ship, depending on the
        specified resolution set. A resolution of 4 will be helpful in knowing
        if there is a neutrino spike off of the port bow very quickly, but not
        in setting a course to it's origin. Higher resolution scans take longer
        to complete, but will yield much more precise readings about locaiton.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scanning range may also be set, again allowing the science officer to
        speed up the process of scanning, by limiting the range and reducing the
        area that needs to be scanned. This is typically useful since most of
        the operational concerns surrounding starship science duties involve the
        immediate environment, and not the other end of the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The top of the scanning circle is course 0, straight ahead of the ship.
        To the left is course 250, the bottom is course 500, and the right is
        course 750. By communicating the rotation around the circle that you
        observe phenomena, you will be able to guide your conn officer to the
        origin of a reading.
