    <h2>Engineering Orientation 01</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        A ship's Chief Engineering officer is perhaps the most important member
        of the bridge crew, as all other functions depend on the engineer to
        keep the ship flying.

    <p>
        From the engineering screen, you are able to quickly scan the status of
        all of the ships systems to see whether they are active, online, or
        damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the power distribution screen, you can transmit and rebalance the
        ship's power output to different systems as needed for the effective
        operation of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
        A word of caution: The engineer is one of the few officers in a
        position to cause accidental damage to a ship's systems if they are are
        not careful in their duties. Although there are many safeties in place,
        the engineer has the authority to by-pass all of them.
