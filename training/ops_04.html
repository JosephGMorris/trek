    <h2>Operations Orientation 04</h2>
    <h3>Repair</h3>
    <p>Through use, many systems onboard a starship will incur damage. It is
        your responsibility to ensure that systems are repaired and maintained
        where possible, and to report any damage that cannot be repaired without
        additional supplies.</p>
    <p>Many systems will continue to function with some damage, albeit at a
        lower rate of efficiency. You thus have the option of repairing a system
        to complete operational status, or only to minimum operational needs.
        The later may be more appropriate to conserve time and materials during
        an emergency.</p>
    <p>When you assign a repair crew, the closest crew not already assigned a
        task will be ordered to the deck and section of that system, and begin
        repairs. Assigning a second crew will speed up repair time.</p>
    <p>It is considered good practice to notify your fellow bridge officers of
        which systems are damaged, and which you are repairing, so that they may
        better know if any of the systems they depend on are compromised, and if
        resupply from the nearest outpost should be requested.</p>
