    <h3>Power Distribution Overload</h3>
    <p>
        When reading a power distribution page, you will note that there is a
        reading beside each system in megadynes (MD). The attached relay is only
        capable of transmitting a given amount of energy through it's circuits
        before it's control systems will blow out and lock the current
        distribution in place. This is a safety feature in an attempt to isolate
        systems in the event of blowout. It is important to be mindful of the
        current capacity of the relay you are dealing with before pushing the
        power level up on any of it's attached systems. If your relay states
        that it is operating at 90% capacity, and you wish to channel more power
        to one of it's attached systems, you must first lower the power of other
        systems to safely increase the capacity of the relay.

    <p>
        In the event that you do blow out a relay, the interface for that relay
        will become unresponsive, and you will have to double check the status
        in the system status page confirm the damage. You should immediately
        request a repair team for any blown EPS relay, as your ability to safely
        control ship's systems depends on their operational status.
