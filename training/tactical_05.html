    <h2>Tactical Orientation 05</h2>
    <h3>Phaser Systems</h3>
    <p>While photon torpedoes offer a great deal of explosive power, it is
        spread out over a wide area of an enemy ship, making it difficult to
        target, damage, and disable certain systems. Additionally, the limited
        orientation of a ship's torpedo tubes can make combat difficult. Phaser
        systems are typically mounted on all sections of a starship, and allow
        a much more flexible targetting and firing approach.</p>
    <p>Since phasers are charged systems it is important to be aware that the
        damage the phaser bank will cause is determined by the charge build up
        by the bank. To decrease the charge time, engineering must divert more
        power to phaser systems. Similar to phasers, shields are also charged
        systems, so phaser combat largely consists of timing your shots and
        focusing your fire to overwhelm a section of an enemy's shields so that
        you can maximize damage to the underlying systems.</p>
    <p>The major drawback to phaser systems is their limited range, and the
        difficulty of their use during warp travel. Outside of a warp field, a
        phaser maybe be fired up to a range of 1,000 km, however within a warp
        field, it is neccessary to first project an extension of the ship's
        field to overlap with that of the target's before firing the beam, which
        limits the range to a mere 5 km. Moving into such close range at warp is
        a challenge even for experienced pilots, and your comm officer may not
        be up to the task.</p>
