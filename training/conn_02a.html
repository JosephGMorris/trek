    <h2>Conn Orientation 02a</h2>
    <h3>Ship Coordinates</h3>
    
    <p>Space is three dimentional, and coordinating position and direction
        can be difficult for Conn officers. The convention used in starfleet is
        to describe rotation and elevation relative to the local stellar body, or
        to the galactic plane when in interstellar space.</p>
