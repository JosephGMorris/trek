    <h3>Power Distribution Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Modern starships are powered primarily by antimater reactors often
        refered to as warp cores. Power from the core is shunted to a special
        warp plasma relay that redirects it to various systems. Many of the
        ships primary systems connect directly to the warp relay, such as the
        nacelles, phaser banks, and structural integrity field. Secondary
        systems, which consume significantly less power, receive their power
        from smaller plasma distribution grids (EPS grids). These grids in turn
        get their plasma from the main warp relay.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the warp core, a starship will typically have two other
        sources of power: Impulse fusion reactors, and battery backups. Impulse
        reactors generate the charge and plasma required for sub-light impulse
        flight, but can also be used as alternate power sources for EPS grids,
        meaning that if warp power is offline, the engineer may opt to attach
        an EPS grid instead to the impulse reactors. If both impulse and warp
        systems are offline, emergency battery backups may be used, to maintain
        life support and other critical systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should be noted that the different power sources aboard a starship
        each generate orders of magnitude of different power output. A warp core
        is required for powering a ship's nacelles, and without it you will be
        incapable of warp flight. Similarily, powering phasers off an impulse
        reactor would significantly increase the time required to charge their
        reserves.
