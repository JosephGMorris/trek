    <h2>Tactical Orientation 06</h2>
    <h3>Shields</h3>
    <p>Shields are a critical part of any tactical engagement; without them, the
        ship's hull is completely defenceless to any enemy fire, and would like
        not withstand any significant attack.</p>
    <p>During combat, you will wish to keep a continual eyes on the shield
        status of your ship, to assit you comm and engineering team in moving
        power to affected systems, as well as orienting the ship in such a maner
        as to protect vulnerable systems.</p>
    <p>The tactical officer is only capable of raising or lowering shields. More
        directly control on subsystems requires the assistance of the
        engineering officer.</p>
