    <h3>Velocity</h3>
    <p>Starships have three magnitudes of velocity: Thrusters, Impulse, and Warp
    </p>
    <p>Thrusters are used for turning, maneuvering, combat, docking, and orbit
        control. Thruster operation is essentially Newtonian, meaning that
        velocity in any direction is preserved unless explicitly reversed.</p>
    <p>Impulse drive uses a subspace field to lower the inertial mass of the
        ship while firing thrusters to allow for a greater acceleration, sitting
        somewhere between a warp and thruster system. Impulse is used for travel
        within a system, for speeds below light speed. Impulse is expressed as a
        fractional velocity between 0 and 1. One quarter impulse is input to the
        ship as 0.25 impulse. Full impulse will yield a different velocity
        depending on ship class.</p>
    <p>Warp drive uses a series of warp coils and subspace fields to modulate
        the spatial distortion around a ship, allowing for faster than light
        travel. Warp scale is exponential, following the equation cw^(10/3),
        meaning that at warp one, a ship is travelling at light speed, whereas a
        ship moving at warp two is travelling 10 times the speed of light. (A
        cruising speed of warp 6 means that a ship travels at 392.5 the speed of
        light). Remember to account for this when increasing and descreasing a
        ship's warp velocity.</p>
