    <h3>Communications</h3>
    <p>Subspace communication allows faster-than-light information transfer and
        is a critical component of a functioning ship's bridge. As the bridge
        officer responsible for communications, you will be charged with hailing
        other vessels, reporting on any notifications from Starfleet, and
        coordinating actions with other star ships.</p>
    <p>On the comms menu, you are able to see message history, and to transmit
        messages as required for the completion of your mission. Some traffic is
        routine banter and operational notification, while other communication
        is vital and relevant to the rest of the bridge's operation. It is your
        duty to pay attention and decide what is relevant.</p>
