    <h2>Tactical Orientation 03</h2>
    <h3>Alerts</h3>
    <p>The tactical officer is responsible for setting ship-wide alert status to
        help coordinate the crew and automate preparation responses. There are
        three alert statuses to be aware of.</p>
    <p>Red Alert is used when the ship needs to be combat ready. Weapons systems
        are charged and activated, torpedo tubes set to autoload, sheilding is
        charge and activated, and full available power is routed to the
        structural integrity field. Red Alert may be called by any bridge
        officer when a threat has emerged and the safety of the ship is in
        immediate danger.</p>
    <p>Yellow Alert is indicated when there is a heightened need for ship's
        safety systems, though not combat. Yellow alert will raise shields and
        shunt additional power to SIF systems.</p>
    <p>Blue Alert is called to indicate potential environmental hazard, and
        alerts crew that potentially hazardous operations are underway. Power is
        set to full for SIF systems. Blue Alert is set for space-dock operations
        as well as certain hazardous environment conditions.</p>
