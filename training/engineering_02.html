    <h3>System Status</h3>
    <p>
        To get a quick sense of the health of your ships systems, and to
        understand what is turned on and what is turned off, it is important
        to view the System Status screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, understand that there are principly two classes of systems on a
        starship, those that maintain some kind of charge, and those that simply
        require power.
    </p>
    <p>
        Charged systems, such as phasers, shields, navigational deflectors, and
        the like, have several modes: offline, online, and active. A shield
        system may be online (meaning it is connected to the power grid,
        receiving power, and actively charging) but not active (meaning it is
        not currently deflecting incoming mater or radiation). When active, a
        charge system consumes it's charge to carry out it's function. When the
        tactical officer raises shields, you will observe that the computer will
        activate all of your shields subsystems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Systems without a charge component are either online or not, and as an
        engineer you are capable of taking certain systems offline yourself. Any
        system that is damaged below it's operational threshold will go offline
        until it is sufficiently repaired. You will then need to bring the
        system back online.
    </p>
    <p>
        System status is indicated in the following way:
    </p>
    <p class='blue'>
        Fully operational and online.
    </p>
    <p class='lightblue'>
        Operational, but damaged. Online.
    </p>
    <p class='green'>
        Offline.
    </p>
    <p class='red'>
        Inoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        A charged system will display it's current charge as well as it's 
        integrity.
